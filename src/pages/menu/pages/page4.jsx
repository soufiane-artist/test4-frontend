        </h3>
        <p>
          For Pomije, it’s a two-way street, since she can rely on Sandberg to be upfront, honest, and quick. “I like working with Erica because it’s easy. If she’s working on something that’s a fit with one of my clients, I get her the quotes and information in a timely manner. If I can’t meet her deadline, I let her know up front. She’s honest about when a friendship is appropriate. For any publicist/writer dynamic, the end goal is a partnership that respects each other's responsibilities and ethics, creating something that lasts.”
